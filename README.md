# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning concept and models

What is Machine learning?

Machine learning works on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to automatically learn and improve from experience.
Example: Amazon echo- relies on machine learning  and with more data it becomes more accurate.

Difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning

Artificial intelligence:  A technique which enables machines to mimic human behavior.
Example: Electronic Game Characters, Chat bot.

Machine Learning: A technique which uses statistical methods, enabling machines to learn from their past data.
Example: Email spam filter

Deep Learning: Subset of machine Learning, composing algorithms that allow a model to train itself and perform tasks.
Example: Natural speech recognition

How Machine learning works?
 
1.	Training data
2.	Train the ML algorithm
3.	Processing
4.	Input new data
5.	Apply ML algorithm 
6.	Check prediction

  a.	If prediction is correct that is the Output
  
  b.	If prediction is incorrect retrain the algorithm
